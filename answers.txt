1- Fine-tuning is training a pre-trained model further on a specific dataset to specialize it for a particular task, making it more accurate and effective for that domain.

2- Incorporating external knowledge can be done using RAG to fetch and use external data, plug-in modules for real-time info such as internet search, or adding structured data directly into prompts.

3- Prompting techniques:
    Zero-shot: No examples provided. Straightforward tasks.
    Few-shot: A few examples included to guide the LLM response. Best when context helps accuracy.
    Chain-of-thought: Step-by-step prompts for logical reasoning tasks.

4- RAG is great for tasks needing up-to-date info or large data sets. Fine-tuning is better for consistent, domain-specific tasks that donâ€™t need frequent updates.
